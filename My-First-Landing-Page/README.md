# Variety-of-Projects

In this project i created my very first landing page.

The idea i went with was sort of a cafe theme. i used the logo i created myself for my brothers cafe and also an image of the shopfront.

The other 4 images i used were stock-free from pexels.com.

I struggled at some points in this project, at one point i could not get the 4 images toline up in a row with the etxt underneath each one.

I also struggled at one point trying to resize the shopfront image and i also struggled getting the sign up button to go to the right of the text in the bottom box.

However, with the use of previous examples and google i managed to figure it out.

i would definetly do this project again as i think i need more practice and i want to get better.
